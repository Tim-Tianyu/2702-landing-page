## Our customers

We aim to provide edge servers to companies that have business with critical latency and bandwidth requirements. for example, a cloud gaming service is a typical service that requires low latency and high bandwidth a traditional central cloud server can not fulfill such requirement, but an edge server that deploys close to the user would easily achieve what cloud servers can not achieve. Other customers, we have include navigation service providers that need to provide real-time analysis on traffic conditions and autonomous vehicles company.

## Our value and offerings

We provide edge server platforms in highly populated areas across several countries, by renting our edge servers in selected areas, our customers can deploy compute and storage service at these area edge servers thus provide low latency services to users at these areas.

## Customer service
We provide technical support to customers using our edge servers, our engineer would provide on-site support, and help customers to make the transition from the old cloud server to our new edge server. Our engineers across the world are always on the call for any potential problems. We also provide custom API development for our customers with special requirements.

## Using our product
You can start using our product from our online control panel if you have used the google cloud platform before you will feel very familiar with this. Users can also access their server by using ssh command.
## What we do
Our main business is to deploy and maintain edge servers around the world in highly populated areas.

## Who are we
We are experts at cloud computing and edge computing, our CTO Tianyu Wang graduate from the University of Toronto have expertise at edge computing and distributed system.

## Pricing
The pricing would depend on different areas, the computing power required, the type of services, and the time of using the server. The pricing would vary from $0.5 per hour to $5 per hour with monthly charges.

## Partner companies
We have partnered with many famous network providers, such as Cisco and Huawei, we usually deploy our services at 5G/4G stations and/or near network switches on backbone network, we partnered with these network providers to ensure high availability and low latency of our edge server
