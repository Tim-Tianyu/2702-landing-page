## Our customers

We aim to provide edge servers to companies that have business with critical latency and bandwidth requirement. for example, cloud gaming service is a typical service that require low latency and high bandwidth a traditioanl central cloud servers can not fulfill such requirement, but an edge server that deploy close to the user would easit achieve what cloud servers can not achieve. Other customers we have include navigation service provider that need to provide real time analysis on traffic conditions and autonomous vehicles company.

## Our value and offerings

We provide edge server paltform at high populated areas across several country, but renting our edge servers in selected areas, our customers is able to deploy compute and storage service at these area edge server thus provide low lantecy services to users at these area.

## Customer service
We provide technical support to customers using our edge servers, our engineer would provide on site support, and help customers to make transition from old cloud server to our new edge server. Our engineer across the world are always on the call for any potential problems. We also provide custom API development for our customers with special requirements.

## Using our product
You can start using our product from our online control panel if you have used google cloud paltform before you will feel very familiar to this. User can also access there server by using ssh command.

## What we do
Our main business is to deploy and maintain edge servers around the worlds at highly populated areas.

## Who are we
We are experts at cloud computing and edge computing, our CTO Tianyu Wang graduate from University of Toronto have expertise at edge computing and distributed system.

## Pricing
The pricing would depend on different area, the compute power required, the type of services and the time using the server. The pricinf would vary from $0.5 per hour to $5 per hour with monthly charges.

## Partner companies
We have partnered with many famous network providers, such as Cisco and Huawei, we usually deploy our services at 5G/4G stations and/or near network switches on backbone network, we partnered with these network providers to ensure high availability and low latency of our edge server.
